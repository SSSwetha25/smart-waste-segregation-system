# smart-waste-segregation-system
A smart waste classification system built using Arduino and ESP32-CAM. This project combines real-time sensor data processing, serial input handling, and Edge Impulse-based image classification to automate the segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. It showcases embedded software design and on-device machine learning.
